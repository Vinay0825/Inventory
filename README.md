## 🏗️ Architecture

ShopEase follows a clean **MVVM** architecture with a unidirectional data flow:

```
Fragment (UI)
    │
    ▼
ViewModel  ←────────────── LiveData / StateFlow
    │
    ▼
Repository
    │
    ├──▶ Firebase Firestore  (remote source of truth)
    └──▶ Local State         (optimistic UI for offline support)
```

### 🧱 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Language** | Java |
| **UI** | XML Layouts + ViewBinding |
| **Navigation** | Android Navigation Component |
| **Architecture** | MVVM (Fragment → ViewModel → Repository) |
| **Database** | Firebase Firestore |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Auth |
| **Barcode Scanning** | CameraX + ML Kit Barcode Scanning |
| **Barcode Generation** | ZXing |
| **Image Storage** | Base64 JPEG in Firestore (no Firebase Storage) |
| **Excel Export** | Apache POI |
| **Background Tasks** | WorkManager |
| **Min SDK** | 24 (Android 7.0) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio **Hedgehog** or later
- JDK 17+
- A Firebase project with **Firestore** and **Authentication** enabled
- A physical Android device or emulator (API 24+)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinay0825/ShopEase.git
cd ShopEase
```

### 2. Set Up Firebase

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Add an **Android app** with your package name (e.g., `com.yourname.shopease`).
3. Download the `google-services.json` file.
4. Place it in the `app/` directory:
   ```
   ShopEase/app/google-services.json
   ```
5. In Firebase Console, enable:
   - **Authentication** → Email/Password sign-in
   - **Cloud Firestore** → Start in test mode (or apply the rules below)

### 3. Firestore Security Rules (Recommended)

```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Build & Run

Open the project in **Android Studio**, let Gradle sync, then run on your device or emulator.

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

> ⚠️ Barcode scanning requires a **physical device** with a rear camera. CameraX does not work on most emulators.
